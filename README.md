## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
software product are mostly developed by a group of people who may be in different locations hence there is need for a each one of them contributes to some specific kind of functionality/features. So in order to contribute to the product, they made modifications to the source code.hence the need for a version control that would keeping a track of modifications done in the code. 
 Git allows developers to work on their own local copies of a repository and then merge their changes together.
 it enhances integrity since  For each different contributor to the project, a different working copy is maintained differently.
## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
